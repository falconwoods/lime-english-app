1
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:09,673
Standing at almost 84 meters tall,

2
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:13,675
this is the largest known living tree
on the planet.

3
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:15,285
Nicknamed General Sherman,

4
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:22,267
this giant sequoia has sequestered
roughly 1,400 tons of atmospheric carbon

5
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:26,888
over its estimated 2,500 years on earth.

6
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:30,718
Very few trees can compete 
with this carbon impact,

7
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:37,009
but today, humanity produces more 
than 1,400 tons of carbon every minute.

8
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,709
To combat climate change,

9
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:42,249
we need to steeply reduce 
fossil fuel emissions,

10
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:47,106
and draw down excess CO2 
to restore our atmosphere’s balance

11
00:00:47,106 --> 00:00:49,195
of greenhouse gases.

12
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:52,025
But what can trees do to help
in this fight?

13
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:55,585
And how do they sequester carbon 
in the first place?

14
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:59,114
Like all plants, trees consume
atmospheric carbon

15
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:02,085
through a chemical reaction 
called photosynthesis.

16
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:04,725
This process uses energy 
from sunlight

17
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:08,265
to convert water and carbon dioxide 
into oxygen

18
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:11,055
and energy-storing carbohydrates.

19
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:15,055
Plants then consume 
these carbohydrates in a reverse process

20
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:17,874
called respiration, 
converting them to energy

21
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:21,165
and releasing carbon 
back into the atmosphere.

22
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:25,379
In trees, however, a large portion
of that carbon isn’t released,

23
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:29,716
and instead, is stored 
as newly formed wood tissue.

24
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:33,575
During their lifetimes, 
trees act as carbon vaults,

25
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:38,055
and they continue to draw down carbon 
for as long as they grow.

26
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:41,035
However, when a tree dies
and decays,

27
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:44,495
some of its carbon will be released
back into the air.

28
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:48,175
A significant amount of CO2
is stored in the soil,

29
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,736
where it can remain 
for thousands of years.

30
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:55,766
But eventually, that carbon
also seeps back into the atmosphere.

31
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:58,795
So if trees are going to help 
fight a long-term problem

32
00:01:58,796 --> 00:01:59,846
like climate change,

33
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:02,453
they need to survive to sequester 
their carbon

34
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:07,542
for the longest period possible, 
while also reproducing quickly.

35
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:11,672
Is there one type of tree 
we could plant that meets these criteria?

36
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:16,212
Some fast growing, long-lived, 
super sequestering species

37
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:18,312
we could scatter worldwide?

38
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:19,922
Not that we know of.

39
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:21,923
But even if such a tree existed,

40
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:24,893
it wouldn’t be a good 
long-term solution.

41
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:28,252
Forests are complex networks 
of living organisms,

42
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:32,753
and there’s no one species 
that can thrive in every ecosystem.

43
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:37,132
The most sustainable trees to plant 
are always native ones;

44
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:41,143
species that already play a role 
in their local environment.

45
00:02:41,143 --> 00:02:43,508
Preliminary research shows 
that ecosystems

46
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:47,407
with a naturally occurring diversity
of trees have less competition

47
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:51,246
for resources and better resist
climate change.

48
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:54,646
This means we can’t just plant trees 
to draw down carbon;

49
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:58,337
we need to restore depleted ecosystems.

50
00:02:58,337 --> 00:03:01,027
There are numerous regions
that have been clear cut

51
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:04,377
or developed that are ripe for restoring.

52
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:08,321
In 2019, a study led 
by Zurich’s Crowtherlab

53
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:12,981
analyzed satellite imagery 
of the world’s existing tree cover.

54
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:15,671
By combining it with climate and soil data

55
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:19,010
and excluding areas necessary
for human use,

56
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:20,961
they determined Earth could support

57
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:24,831
nearly one billion hectares 
of additional forest.

58
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:29,032
That’s roughly 1.2 trillion trees.

59
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:32,763
This staggering number surprised
the scientific community,

60
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:34,643
prompting additional research.

61
00:03:34,644 --> 00:03:39,187
Scientists now cite a more conservative 
but still remarkable figure.

62
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:43,347
By their revised estimates,
these restored ecosystems

63
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:48,932
could capture anywhere from 100 to 200
billion tons of carbon,

64
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:53,372
accounting for over one-sixth
of humanity’s carbon emissions.

65
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:55,662
More than half of the potential
forest canopy

66
00:03:55,663 --> 00:04:00,092
for new restoration efforts 
can be found in just six countries.

67
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:04,922
And the study can also provide insight
into existing restoration projects,

68
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:06,402
like The Bonn Challenge,

69
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:12,025
which aims to restore 350 million hectares
of forest by 2030.

70
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:14,555
But this is where it gets complicated.

71
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:17,056
Ecosystems are incredibly complex,

72
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:21,510
and it’s unclear whether they’re best 
restored by human intervention.

73
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,980
It’s possible the right thing 
to do for certain areas

74
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,600
is to simply leave them alone.

75
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,419
Additionally, some researchers
worry that restoring forests

76
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,859
on this scale may have unintended 
consequences,

77
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,179
like producing natural bio-chemicals

78
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,454
at a pace that could actually 
accelerate climate change.

79
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:44,654
And even if we succeed 
in restoring these areas,

80
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:47,314
future generations would need
to protect them

81
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:52,384
from the natural and economic forces
that previously depleted them.

82
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:55,930
Taken together, these challenges
have damaged confidence

83
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,610
in restoration projects worldwide.

84
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,639
And the complexity 
of rebuilding ecosystems

85
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,166
demonstrates how important 
it is to protect our existing forests.

86
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:09,658
But hopefully, restoring 
some of these depleted regions

87
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:13,737
will give us the data and conviction 
necessary to combat climate change

88
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:15,826
on a larger scale.

89
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:19,931
If we get it right, maybe these modern
trees will have time to grow

90
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:22,246
into carbon carrying titans.
